### Sample Name - PHP Developer Student 

I have three years of experience as a teacher. In addition, I have a degree in Business Administration and two completed years of a Computer Science degree. I'm a student at Jagaad Academy and have been focusing on Backend development with PHP, Symfony, MySQL, and Object-Oriented Programming. Check out some of my projects here on GitHub; they cover different topics I'm studying. **I'm looking for an opportunity in a company to start as a junior or intern developer.**
